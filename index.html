                    Hey Manushi, First of all happy birthday. If I wasn't a bad singer, this song playing would have probably been by yours truly 😌 
                    but in a male voice ofcourse 😂
                    Anyway, I just want to let you know that you are an amazing friend and I don't take this for granted, 
                    As you get a year older, I just want to encourage you to keep on pushing forward. 
                    One thing I'm sure of is your persistence towards things you are passionate about, don't ever lose that. 
                    Your kindness and empathy is also something I admire. I wish you all the best in your life and may things always work in your favor
                    Happiest birthday manushi. Keep on being you. Just know that I will always be there whenever. 
                  
                    Happy birthday 🥳🥳🎉🎈...
